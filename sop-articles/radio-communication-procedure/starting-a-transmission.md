# Starting a Transmission:

* Press the Push-To-Talk (PTT) button and wait for about a second before speaking to avoid cutting off the beginning of your message.
* Begin with the call sign of the unit you are calling followed by your own call sign. Example: "Permission to direct contact." _cut out, pause, then continue_ - "411, this is Q113, over."&#x20;

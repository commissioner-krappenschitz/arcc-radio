# Obtaining and Programming Radios:

* If you have obtained or own a personal handheld radio, it must be handed over to the department head for programming.
* The department head will set up the groupâ€™s frequency on the radio to ensure it aligns with our communication protocols.
* Once programmed, radios must not be reprogrammed or altered without approval from the department head.

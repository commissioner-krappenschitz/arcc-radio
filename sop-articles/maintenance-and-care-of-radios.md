# Maintenance and Care of Radios

1. **Regular Checks**: Ensure your radio is functioning properly before each shift. Check battery levels, signal strength, and audio clarity.
2. **Proper Handling**: Handle radios with care. Avoid dropping them or exposing them to water unless they are specifically designed to be waterproof.
3. **Charging**: Keep radios charged and have spare batteries available. Do not overcharge as it can damage the battery.
4. **Storage**: Store radios in a safe, dry place when not in use.
